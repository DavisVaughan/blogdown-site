# Intro

Welcome to my first post! To start things off at Data Insights, I'm going to show you how to connect to an AWS RDS instance from R.

For those of you who don't know, RDS is an easy way to create a database in the cloud. In this post, I won't be showing you how to setup an RDS instance, but I will show you how to connect to it if you have one running.

Let's get started.

# Step 1: The one where you got connected

You'll need a few packages to get started. 

* `DBI` and `MySQL` are used to connect to the database, although MySQL is usually called without explicitely loading it (that's just the standard)
* `tidyquant` is just there to help us download some data to put in and get out of our database
* `dplyr` will be used to show off an alternate way to query from the database

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(DBI)
#library(MySQL)
library(tidyquant)
library(dplyr)
```

Getting connected isn't too hard once you know what you're looking for. Let's go through the arguments to `dbConnect()`, the function from `DBI` that we will be using to connect.

* `drv` - The driver I'll be using is from the `RMySQL` package, an implementation of the general interface provided by `DBI`. I'll leave it to [the experts](https://github.com/rstats-db/DBI) to explain all of this.
* `username` / `password` - You'll have to have created a user and password on AWS first, but then you can use them here.
* `host` - The host name is the Endpoint of your RDS server, without the port on the end. I've attached a screenshot to show where to find this. Basically, on the RDS Dashboard Instances page, hit the drop down arrow beside "MySQL" to show the Endpoint.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/aws-rds-r/2017-05-10-aws-dashboard.png")
```

* `port` - The rest of the Endpoint shows the port that you'll need to access your RDS instance through. That goes here.
* `dbname` - Finally, you'll need the DB Name you used when setting up the instance. This can be found by clicking Instance Actions -> See Details, and then under Configuration Details you'll find DB Name.

Now that you've got all the pieces, throw them together to create a connection the the database.

```{r}
cn <- dbConnect(drv = RMySQL::MySQL(), 
                username = "user1", 
                password = "testpassword", 
                host = "davisdbinstance.crarljboc8to.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com", 
                port = 3306, 
                dbname = "firstdb")
```

# Step 2: The one where you take it for a test spin

Well, alright...that was...cool? How do we know it's working? Let's get some data to load into the database. We will use some Apple stock data retrieved through `tidyquant`.

```{r}
aapl <- tq_get("AAPL")

slice(aapl, 1:10)
``` 

Write the tibble to the database using DBI. 

- Already done, don't run again.
- User only has SELECT privelages anyways.

```{r}
#dbWriteTable(cn, "apple", aapl)
```

Pull it back down using SQL in RMarkdown! 

- Note that dates did get converted to chr.
- Only pulls first 1000 rows.

```{sql connection=cn}
SELECT * 
FROM apple;
```

Pull it back down using the DBI package in R! 

- Pulls all rows.

```{r}
x <- dbGetQuery(cn, "SELECT * FROM apple;")

slice(x, 1:10)
```

Make sure and disconnect so we can try other things.

```{r }
dbDisconnect(cn)
```


Now, redo the connection but use dplyr!

```{r}
cn <- src_mysql(user = "user1", 
                password = "testpassword", 
                host = "davisdbinstance.crarljboc8to.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com", 
                port = 3306, 
                dbname = "firstdb")
```

Select the apple table from that database. This does not actually pull in the data. Just makes the connection!

```{r}
apple_table <- tbl(cn, "apple")
```

We can use almost any dplyr command with this! It queries the database, and does not do the manipulation in R. This is insane.

```{r}
apple_table %>% select(date, adjusted)
```

A dplyr `filter()`.

```{r}
apple_table %>% filter(date < "2008-01-01")
```

IBM added to the database using `copy_to()`. 

- Dont run this either, already done.

```{r}
#ibm <- tq_get("IBM")

#copy_to(cn, ibm, temporary = FALSE)
```

Pull down IBM, then mutate it to add daily returns using `tidyquant`.

```{r}
ibm_table <- tbl(cn, "ibm")
real_tibble <- collect(ibm_table)
real_tibble$date <- as.Date(real_tibble$date)

real_tibble <- real_tibble %>% 
  tq_mutate(ohlc_fun = Ad, 
            mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
            period = "daily")
```


```{r}
real_tibble
```
